# About

The `zmq` crate provides bindings for the `libzmq` library from the
[ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) project. The API exposed by `zmq` should
be safe (in the usual Rust sense), but it follows the C API closely,
so it is not very idiomatic.

# Fork Status

This repository is a maintained fork of
[erickt/rust-zmq](https://github.com/erickt/rust-zmq).

Why this fork exists:

- Upstream appears to have limited maintenance activity.
- There was significant backlog in open pull requests and issues.
- Downstream users needed fixes that were not available in a published release.

What has been integrated in this fork:

- Curve/libsodium support fixes and build integration.
- `zmq-sys` dependency updates and zeromq-src baseline updates.
- Selected non-breaking API improvements: `ZMQ_INVERT_MATCHING`,
  `ZMQ_TCP_MAXRT`, `set_xpub_verboser`, and `AsFd`/`AsSocket` support.
- 32-bit build compatibility and test/toolchain upkeep (bitflags 2.x, trybuild snapshots).
- Safety/correctness hardening: reject interior-NUL property names in `has`
  and `Message::gets`; guard pathological `Message` allocation sizes.
- Added fuzzing harness + scheduled ASAN smoke workflow.

This fork currently keeps crate package names unchanged (`zmq`, `zmq-sys`) to
minimize downstream migration cost.

If you need to force this fork in a workspace:

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
zmq = { git = "https://github.com/rdaum/rust-zmq.git", branch = "main" }
zmq-sys = { git = "https://github.com/rdaum/rust-zmq.git", branch = "main" }
```

# Compatibility

The aim of this project is to track latest zmq releases as close as possible.

Regarding the minimum Rust version required, `zmq` is CI-tested on current 
stable channels of Rust. 

# Usage

`zmq` is a pretty straight forward port of the C API into Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let ctx = zmq::Context::new();

    let socket = ctx.socket(zmq::REQ).unwrap();
    socket.connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:1234").unwrap();
    socket.send("hello world!", 0).unwrap();
}
```

You can find more usage examples in
https://github.com/erickt/rust-zmq/tree/master/examples.

# Notes

## Process environment safety

`libzmq` may read process environment variables internally. Avoid mutating the
process environment (for example via `std::env::set_var`/`remove_var`) after
creating `zmq::Context` values or while other threads may be using `zmq`.

## Shutdown and linger

Sockets default to `ZMQ_LINGER = -1` (infinite), so dropping a socket can block
while pending outbound messages flush. For fast shutdown, set `socket.set_linger(0)`.
